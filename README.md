# Creating your first site with HTML and CSS and how to open it in the browser
Type out all of the commands I give you below and follow the steps. **Do not get used to copying and pasting!**


### 1. Open Command Prompt(PC) or Terminal(Mac)
### 2. Run this command to see what folders/files you already have 
Get in the habit of doing this often.
```ls```
### 3. Create a "dev" folder
This is where you will keep everyting you create from now on
```mkdir dev```
### 4. Run this command again.
You can see that the folder "dev" that you just created is visible and created.
```ls```
### 5. Now lets go into your "dev" folder
```cd dev```
### 6. Create a new folder for this project.
You can name this whatever you want, just make sure it follows these naming rules:
1. The name always has to start with a lower case letter and **never** a number
2. If the name is more than one word the words can be seperated by a a dash(-) or following the (n)ew(F)older naming style(example: helloWorld, newSite, firstSite, myFirstWebsite, hello-world, new-site, my-first-website)
···The most common is probably the newFolder naming style.
```mkdir yourFolderName```
### 7. You can see this created now!
```ls```
### 8. Go into your new folder
```cd yourFolderName```
### 9. Create two files (HTML & CSS)
Side Note: You can always run commands in the same line seperated by a space, or you can run them seperately.
```touch index.html```
```touch style.css```
or
```touch index.html style.css```
### 10. You can see these created now!
```ls```
### 11. Now that the files are created you can open them in the IDE and in your folders
Running this command will open them in your folders.
```open .```
Running this command will open them in your IDE(text editor).
```code .```
__You don't really need the folder and files open in your computer's main folder organizer so you can go ahead and close that, I just wanted you to see that you can open it through Command Prompt or Terminal.__
### . Now that your files are opened in VS Code, create your HTML boilerplate in your HTML file.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>title</title>
    <!--This is a comment tag. You can add comments anywhere in your code by using the these symbols on each end. -->
    <!--The title can be named whatever you want. Go ahead and change that! It will usually be titled whatever you titled your folder for this site. It doesn't have to follow the naming style so feel free to type it out normally (example: My First Site).-->
  </head>
  <body>
  
  </body>
</html>
```
### . Add a Title, Header, Photo, Paragraph (using lorem), and a Link in your HTML file.
### . Link your CSS file in your HTML.
### . In your CSS file, add this styling.
